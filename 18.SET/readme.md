## SET

Super Exact Test were performed to identify significant overlap between HOGs of in different set of species
SET was used for DEG after pairwise comparison of worker and reproductives

SET_DEG_pairwiseWORE.R

SET was used for DEG after pairwise comparison of soldier and reproductives

SET_DEG_pairwiseSORE.R

SET was used for DEG after pairwise comparison of worker and soldiers

SET_DEG_pairwiseWOSO.R

SET was used to identify significant overlap among caste specific networks

_SET_CSG.R

and network wich gene specificity was attributed after pairwise comparison between Worker and reproductives

_SET_WoReGCN.R
