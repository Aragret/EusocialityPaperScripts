## Gene co-expression network construction

The wTO network are created for each caste of each species after normalisation of the readcounts

Network_normalised.sh and wTO-network_Normalised.R

Further the species networks are compared and caste specificity of the gene is allocated with CoDiNA.
The comparison either include all castes sampled

Compare_networks_for_HPC.sh and Compare_networks_for_HPC.R

or through pairwise comparison of the reproductive and the worker caste

Pairwise_comparison_networks_for_HPC.sh and Pairwise_comparison_networks_for_HPC.R
